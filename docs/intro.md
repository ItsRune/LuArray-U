# Getting Started

To get started with using the `LuArray-U` library, you need to require it in your Lua script. You can do this by using the `require` function.

```lua
local LuArray = require("LuArray")
```

If you're on the Roblox end of things:

```lua
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local LuArray = require(ReplicatedStorage.LuArray)
```
